# Interfacing-16x2-LCD-with-8051-Microcontroller
 The given code is for interfacing a 16x2 alphanumeric LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) with an 8051 microcontroller. The 8051 microcontroller is a popular 8-bit microcontroller widely used for various embedded applications.

If "num" reaches -129, it is reset to 127, creating a continuous loop that cycles through numbers from 127 to -129 on the LCD display.

Please note that the specific working of this code depends on the hardware connections and the type of 16x2 LCD used. The code assumes a basic 16x2 LCD with a Hitachi HD44780-compatible controller. If you have a different LCD module, you may need to adjust the initialization sequence and command values accordingly.
